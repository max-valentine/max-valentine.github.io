2022-06-26	Additively Manufactured Metal Tooling for Cure Optimisation in Composite Manufacturing	Proceedings of 20th European Conference on Composite Materials	"The selection of tooling for composite manufacturing is a critical step in ensuring the quality of the resultant composite parts. The energy consumed during part manufacturing is used to evolve the composite properties but a substantial proportion of it is used to heat the tooling. Additive manufacturing (AM) offers a viable solution to reducing the tooling mass by generating complex tool architectures that can withstand the manufacturing process reduce mass and provide additional functionalities. A series of 16 lattice steel tools were additively manufactured and used to cure flat composite specimens. The thermal profile of the composite curing was monitored to characterise the thermal responsiveness of the tools. The curing of composites on equivalent solid monolithic tools of constant thickness was numerically simulated using a cure-coupled heat transfer model. The results indicate that AM tools with lattice architectures can achieve heating rates higher than 83% of the set rate while keeping the exothermic overshoot temperature below 30% of the setpoint, which its monolithic counterparts couldn't achieve. Hence lattice structures enabled by AM can push the design space into regions previously unavailable to tooling design."	"Radhakrishnan, A., Maes, V. K., Valentine, M., Valero, M. D.

2022-07-19	Plantar Pressure Characteristics of Skeleton Athletes During the Push Start on a Dry-Land Training Surface	Proceedings of the 2022 International Society of Biomechanics in Sport	"The purpose of this study was to gain an initial understanding of patterns and key characteristics of the plantar pressure maps through the push start of top-level skeleton athletes. Skeleton is a dynamic winter sport where athletes propel themselves down an ice track often at speeds in excess of 120km/h. To achieve the best results demanded of the top level, the push start phase is a vital component. Advantages gained here can be the difference between finishing 10th and achieving gold. Therefore, there has been a focus on the performance characteristics of the entire push start in recent research to help understand how to reduce the total time and increase the athlete's speed going into the run. Wearing Medilogic wireless insoles in their usual spiked training shoes, five international skeleton athletes each performed 3-5 maximal effort push starts on a dry-land push track. Using statistical parametric mapping on the 2-d plantar pressure maps, key areas of different pressure patterns were identified with a confidence interval of <0.05. The main findings from the analysis include a higher-pressure concentration on the medial edge of the outside foot than the inside foot through the start and an anterior shift in the pressure concentration during the acceleration phase versus the loading phase of the push start. These results can be used to gain a deeper understanding of the skeleton push start mechanics for comparing different running modalities and surfaces, and to help support optimal equipment choice."

2022-10-19	Additive Manufacturing of Star Structured Auxetic Lattices With Overhanging Links	Proceedings of 2022 International Additive Manufacturing Conference	"Additive manufacturing has been the driving force behind the growth of metamaterials as a field. Commonly taking the form of lattices, these structures can achieve a range of novel macroscale properties that stem from the cumulative effects of locally designed mechanisms. A wide array of mechanical metamaterials have already been designed using computational methods, but these rarely undergo physical testing, often as a result of manufacturing difficulties. This work approaches the problem of manufacturing complex metamaterial test samples though a case study of 3D petal-based auxetic star lattices. This structure was developed computationally to have a strict thickness minimum relative to cell scale. It has been manufactured and subjected to mechanical testing for validation. The unit cells used a 3D re-entrant mechanism with rotational symmetry so require a linkage structures with overhanging elements which is a common feature in metamaterial concepts but challenging to print. Trials of the test samples were manufactured using a thermoplastic polyurethane filament combined with polyvinyl acetate support at 20, 30 and 40 mm unit cell sizes. It was found that the main geometric challenges for successful printing were the link thickness and the reliability of the prints. To address unreliability, the geometry was cut into layers of cells with adhesive-connected feet and printed in parts for post-process assembly. The layered approach was tested successfully and was estimated to reduce the number of cells needed to be attempted to print the full lattice by over 80%. The use of dissolvable support material proved viable for printing overhanging links, but requires use of fused deposition modelling so a relatively low part resolution. The trial led to a five point design guide methodology for meta material test samples. Combined with cell mathematical definitions that strictly bound link thickness to take minimum print resolution into account, this methodology can be applied to other metamaterials and help bridge the gap between theoretical lattices and physical testing."

2022-10-19	A Feasibility Study of Additively Manufactured Composite Tooling 	Proceedings of 2022 International Additive Manufacturing Conference	"As the flexibility and reliability of additive manufacturing (AM) and its corresponding design tools increases, AM is becoming a viable option for many industries. One particular application area that could benefit from AM is composite component manufacture. The layup and moulding of composite materials face significant challenges presented by increasingly compressed design timescales, growing demand for productivity, and the soaring complexity of components and end products. Furthermore, the UK has made sustainability a priority to meet its obligation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 68% by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050. While lightweight composite structures are expected to help reduce emissions during operation, energy is still the single biggest factor in the lifecycle analysis of the manufacturing process. The way in which composite curing equipment and tooling are designed and manufactured has not changed since high-performance composites were first used in aerospace applications in the 1970s. Therefore, there is an immediate potential to save energy by reducing the mass of the curing equipment and tooling and enhancing process heat transmission. As a result of the aspect ratio of typical composite parts and therefore the size of the required autoclaves, energy is wasted heating and cooling the thermal mass of the curing equipment and tooling during each curing cycle. The poor heat transfer attainable by convection in autoclaves exacerbates this inefficiency."	"Valentine, M., Radhakrishnan, A., Maes, V., Pegg, E., Valero, M., Kratz, J., & Dhokia, V.

2023-04-05	Optimization and Experimental Validation of 3D Near-Isotropic Auxetic Structures	Materials & Design	"The maturation of additive manufacturing has caused an explosion in lattice metamaterials. One of the most promising metamaterial families are auxetics, but these structures often exhibit anisotropy which limits their use. In this study, novel polygon celled 3D star structures were investigated and engineered to counteract design deficiencies. A new lattice design ontology was developed and used to carry out low cost optimisation with curved links. The resulting cells opened new forms of symmetry which were shown to reduce the anisotropy of the lattices by between 75% and 90%. The cubic and rhombic dodecahedral cells performed promisingly with Poisson's ratios of -0.449 and -0.401 and anisotropic range of 0.022 and 0.085 respectively. Link thickness was parameterised and used to aid cell scaling and balance stiffness and metamaterial behaviour while ensuring cell manufacturability. The experiments demonstrated that the geometrical simplicity was beneficial to the cell properties and the success probability of the manufacturing process. The new optimisation method described in this study has been demonstrated to be sufficiently low cost to be applied at the cell level. It will pave the way to practical strain based design of graded structures which are vital for the practical growth of metamaterials."	"Rogers, B. A., Valentine, M. D. A., Lunt, A. J. G., Pegg, E.

2023-06-30	"Characterisation of Residual Stresses and Oxides in Titanium, Nickel, and Aluminium Alloy Additive Manufacturing Powders via Synchrotron X-Ray Diffraction"	Materials Today Communications	"The strength and fracture toughness of Additively Manufactured (AM) components are significantly influenced by the concentration and size of oxides and precipitate inclusions within the build powders. These features are highly sensitive to powder production parameters, as well as the number of times a powder has been reused. In this study synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction was performed in an inert atmosphere at room temperature and during in-situ heating, providing crucial insights into growth rates and distribution of oxides and precipitates as a function of temperature. From the high angular resolution data collected, the structural refinement showed that plasma wire arc atomisation shows lower residual strain than gas atomised powder samples at room temperature after atomisation likely due to lower temperatures achieved during the production process. Additionally, the results from the diffraction patterns collected during in-situ heating provide key insights to the four metal powders considered in this study, Ti-6Al-4 V, Ni718, AlSi10Mg, and Scalmalloy. This paper also highlights the potential that using synchrotron X-ray diffraction to study AM parts and constituent AM powder has to gain crucial insight into material properties and the build reliability of end use production quality parts from AM."

2023-08-31	Additively Manufactured Cure Tools for Composites Manufacture	International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology	"This research presents a novel framework for the design of additively manufactured (AM) composite tooling for the manufacture of carbon fibre-reinforced plastic composites. Through the rigorous design and manufacture of 30 unique AM tools, the viability of a design for AM framework was evaluated through measuring the performance with respect to geometrical accuracy and thermal responsiveness, and simulating the tool specific stiffness. The AM components consisted of a thin layup facesheet, stiffened by a low density lattice geometry. These tools were successfully used to layup and cure small composite components. The tooling was highly thermally responsive, reaching above 93% of the applied oven heating rate and up to 17% faster heating rates compared to similar mass monolithic tools. The results indicate that thermal overshoot has a greater dependence on the lattice density while the heating rate was more sensitive to the facesheet thickness. Lattice densities of as little as 5% were manufactured and the best overall geometry was a graded gyroid lattice with thicker walls near the surface and thinner walls at the base, attached to a 0.7 mm thick facesheet. The outputs from this research can provide a new route to the design and manufacture of mould tools, which could have significant impacts in the composites sector with new, lighter, more energy efficient tooling."
