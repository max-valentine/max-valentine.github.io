26/06/2022	Additively Manufactured Metal Tooling for Cure Optimisation in Composite Manufacturing	Proceedings of 20th European Conference on Composite Materials	"The selection of tooling for composite manufacturing is a critical step in ensuring the quality of the resultant composite parts. The energy consumed during part manufacturing is used to evolve the composite properties but a substantial proportion of it is used to heat the tooling. Additive manufacturing (AM) offers a viable solution to reducing the tooling mass by generating complex tool architectures that can withstand the manufacturing process reduce mass and provide additional functionalities. A series of 16 lattice steel tools were additively manufactured and used to cure flat composite specimens. The thermal profile of the composite curing was monitored to characterise the thermal responsiveness of the tools. The curing of composites on equivalent solid monolithic tools of constant thickness was numerically simulated using a curecoupled heat transfer model. The results indicate that AM tools with lattice architectures can achieve heating rates higher than 83% of the set rate while keeping the exothermic overshoot temperature below 30% of the setpoint, which its monolithic counterparts couldn’t achieve. Hence lattice structures enabled by AM can push the design space into regions previously unavailable to tooling design. "	"Radhakrishnan, A. , Maes, V. K., Valentine, M., Valero, M. D.

The push start is a vital component in skeleton to achieve success, and therefore, a focus on the performance characteristics of the push start could help to reduce the run time and increase the athlete’s initial velocity. Five international
skeleton athletes each performed 3-5 push starts on a dry-land push track with wireless pressure insoles. Key differences in 2-d plantar pressure patterns were identified with a confidence interval of ?<0.05 using statistical parametric mapping. This displayed a higher pressure-concentration on the medial edge of the outside foot through the full start and an anterior shift in the pressure-concentration during the acceleration phase. These results could be used for understanding start mechanics and to help support equipment choice."

19/10/2022	Additive Manufacturing of Star Structured Auxetic Lattices With Overhanging Links	Proceedings of 2022 International Additive Manufacturing Conference	"Additive manufacturing has been the driving force behind the growth of metamaterials as a field. Commonly taking the form of lattices, these structures can achieve a range of novel macroscale properties that stem from the cumulative effects of locally designed mechanisms. A wide array of mechanical metamaterials have already been designed using computational methods, but these rarely undergo physical testing, often as a result of manufacturing difficulties.

This work approaches the problem of manufacturing complex metamaterial test samples though a case study of 3D petal-based auxetic star lattices. These lattice structures have linkage structures with overhanging elements, which is a common feature in metamaterial concepts but challenging to print. Trials of the test samples were manufactured using a thermoplastic polyurethane filament combined with polyvinyl acetate support at 20, 30 and 40 mm unit cell sizes. It was found that the main geometric challenges for successful printing were the link thickness and the reliability of the prints. To address unreliability, the geometry was cut into layers of cells with adhesive-connected feet and printed in parts for post-process assembly.

The layered approach was tested successfully and was estimated to reduce the number of cells needed to be attempted to print the full lattice by over 80%. The use of dissolvable support material proved viable for printing overhanging links, but requires use of fused deposition modelling so a relatively low part resolution. The trial led to a five point design guide methodology for metamaterial test samples. Combined with cell mathematical definitions that strictly bound link thickness to take minimum print resolution into account, this methodology can be applied to other metamaterials and help bridge the gap between theoretical lattices and physical testing."

19/10/2022	A Feasibility Study of Additively Manufactured Composite Tooling 	Proceedings of 2022 International Additive Manufacturing Conference	"As the flexibility and reliability of additive manufacturing (AM) and its corresponding design tools increases, it is becoming a viable option for more industries. One application area that could benefit from AM is composite component manufacture. The layup and molding of composite materials face significant challenges presented by tight design timescales, growing demand for productivity, and the complexity of components and end products. Therefore, there is an immediate potential to save energy by reducing the mass of the curing equipment and tooling to enhance process heat transmission. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the reduction of embodied energy within mold tools that are printed using an AM process. Using an AM approach, it is possible to design lightweight curing tools to increase the curing rate and quality of heat distribution in the mold. The viability of additively producing these cure tools was assessed by analyzing the geometrical precision of the composite mold outputs, material utilization, and heat transmission qualities of each sample. In this study, 14 cure tools were designed and manufactured with a 100 mm2 curing surface area, top plate thickness of 1–2 mm, and stiffening lattices behind the curing surface with a depth of 10 mm. Four lattice geometries, gyroid, dual-wall gyroid, planar diamond, and stochastic, were tested based on their overall geometrical accuracy and thermal responsiveness. While the stochastic lattice had the best single tool properties, the planar diamond and gyroid lattice tools had better potential for future use in the design of additively manufactured composite tooling."

05/04/2023	Optimization and Experimental Validation of 3D Near-Isotropic Auxetic Structures	Materials & Design	"The maturation of additive manufacturing has caused an explosion in lattice metamaterials. One of the most promising metamaterial families are auxetics, but these structures often exhibit anisotropy which limits their use. In this study, novel polygon celled 3D star structures were investigated and engineered to counteract design deficiencies. A new lattice design ontology was developed and used to carry out low cost optimisation with curved links. The resulting cells opened new forms of symmetry which were shown to reduce the anisotropy of the lattices by between 75% and 90%. The cubic and rhombic dodecahedral cells performed promisingly with Poisson’s ratios of ?0.449 and ?0.401 and anisotropic range of 0.022 and 0.085 respectively. Link thickness was parameterised and used to aid cell scaling and balance stiffness and metamaterial behaviour while ensuring cell manufacturability. The experiments demonstrated that the geometrical simplicity was beneficial to the cell properties and the success probability of the manufacturing process. The new optimisation method described in this study has been demonstrated to be sufficiently low cost to be applied at the cell level. It will pave the way to practical strain based design of graded structures which are vital for the practical growth of metamaterials."	"Rogers, B. A., Valentine, M. D. A., Lunt, A. J. G., Pegg, E.

30/06/2023	"Characterisation of Residual Stresses and Oxides in Titanium, Nickel, and Aluminium Alloy Additive Manufacturing Powders via Synchrotron X-Ray Diffraction"	Materials Today Communications	"The strength and fracture toughness of Additively Manufactured (AM) components are significantly influenced by the concentration and size of oxides and precipitate inclusions within the build powders. These features are highly sensitive to powder production parameters, as well as the number of times a powder has been reused. In this study synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction was performed in an inert atmosphere at room temperature and during in-situ heating, providing crucial insights into growth rates and distribution of oxides and precipitates as a function of temperature. From the high angular resolution data collected, the structural refinement showed that plasma wire arc atomisation shows lower residual strain than gas atomised powder samples at room temperature after atomisation likely due to lower temperatures achieved during the production process. Additionally, the results from the diffraction patterns collected during in-situ heating provide key insights to the four metal powders considered in this study, Ti-6Al-4 V, Ni718, AlSi10Mg, and Scalmalloy. This paper also highlights the potential that using synchrotron X-ray diffraction to study AM parts and constituent AM powder has to gain crucial insight into material properties and the build reliability of end use production quality parts from AM."

31/08/2023	Additively Manufactured Cure Tools for Composites Manufacture	International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology	"This research presents a novel framework for the design of additively manufactured (AM) composite tooling for the manufacture of carbon fibre-reinforced plastic composites. Through the rigorous design and manufacture of 30 unique AM tools, the viability of a design for AM framework was evaluated through measuring the performance with respect to geometrical accuracy and thermal responsiveness, and simulating the tool specific stiffness. The AM components consisted of a thin layup facesheet, stiffened by a low density lattice geometry. These tools were successfully used to layup and cure small composite components. The tooling was highly thermally responsive, reaching above 93\% of the applied oven heating rate and up to 17\% faster heating rates compared to similar mass monolithic tools. The results indicate that thermal overshoot has a greater dependence on the lattice density while the heating rate was more sensitive to the facesheet thickness. Lattice densities of as little as 5\% were manufactured and the best overall geometry was a graded gyroid lattice with thicker walls near the surface and thinner walls at the base, attached to a 0.7 mm thick facesheet. The outputs from this research can provide a new route to the design and manufacture of mould tools, which could have significant impacts in the composites sector with new, lighter, more energy efficient tooling."
