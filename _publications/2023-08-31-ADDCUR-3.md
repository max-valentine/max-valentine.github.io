excerpt: 'This research presents a novel framework for the design of additively manufactured (AM) composite tooling for the manufacture of carbon fibre-reinforced plastic composites. Through the rigorous design and manufacture of 30 unique AM tools, the viability of a design for AM framework was evaluated through measuring the performance with respect to geometrical accuracy and thermal responsiveness, and simulating the tool specific stiffness. The AM components consisted of a thin layup facesheet, stiffened by a low density lattice geometry. These tools were successfully used to layup and cure small composite components. The tooling was highly thermally responsive, reaching above 93% of the applied oven heating rate and up to 17% faster heating rates compared to similar mass monolithic tools. The results indicate that thermal overshoot has a greater dependence on the lattice density while the heating rate was more sensitive to the facesheet thickness. Lattice densities of as little as 5% were manufactured and the best overall geometry was a graded gyroid lattice with thicker walls near the surface and thinner walls at the base, attached to a 0.7 mm thick facesheet. The outputs from this research can provide a new route to the design and manufacture of mould tools, which could have significant impacts in the composites sector with new, lighter, more energy efficient tooling.'

This research presents a novel framework for the design of additively manufactured (AM) composite tooling for the manufacture of carbon fibre-reinforced plastic composites. Through the rigorous design and manufacture of 30 unique AM tools, the viability of a design for AM framework was evaluated through measuring the performance with respect to geometrical accuracy and thermal responsiveness, and simulating the tool specific stiffness.

The tooling was highly thermally responsive, reaching above 93% of the applied oven heating rate and up to 17% faster heating rates compared to similar mass monolithic tools. The results indicate that thermal overshoot has a greater dependence on the lattice density while the heating rate was more sensitive to the facesheet thickness. Lattice densities of as little as 5% were manufactured and the best overall geometry was a graded gyroid lattice with thicker walls near the surface and thinner walls at the base, attached to a 0.7 mm thick facesheet.
