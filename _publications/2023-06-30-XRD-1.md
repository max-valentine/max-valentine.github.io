excerpt: 'The strength and fracture toughness of Additively Manufactured (AM) components are significantly influenced by the concentration and size of oxides and precipitate inclusions within the build powders. These features are highly sensitive to powder production parameters, as well as the number of times a powder has been reused. In this study synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction was performed in an inert atmosphere at room temperature and during in-situ heating, providing crucial insights into growth rates and distribution of oxides and precipitates as a function of temperature. From the high angular resolution data collected, the structural refinement showed that plasma wire arc atomisation shows lower residual strain than gas atomised powder samples at room temperature after atomisation likely due to lower temperatures achieved during the production process. Additionally, the results from the diffraction patterns collected during in-situ heating provide key insights to the four metal powders considered in this study, Ti-6Al-4 V, Ni718, AlSi10Mg, and Scalmalloy. This paper also highlights the potential that using synchrotron X-ray diffraction to study AM parts and constituent AM powder has to gain crucial insight into material properties and the build reliability of end use production quality parts from AM.'

The strength and fracture toughness of Additively Manufactured (AM) components are significantly influenced by the concentration and size of oxides and precipitate inclusions within the build powders. These features are highly sensitive to powder production parameters, as well as the number of times a powder has been reused. In this study synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction was performed in an inert atmosphere at room temperature and during in-situ heating, providing crucial insights into growth rates and distribution of oxides and precipitates as a function of temperature. From the high angular resolution data collected, the structural refinement showed that plasma wire arc atomisation shows lower residual strain than gas atomised powder samples at room temperature after atomisation likely due to lower temperatures achieved during the production process. Additionally, the results from the diffraction patterns collected during in-situ heating provide key insights to the four metal powders considered in this study, Ti-6Al-4 V, Ni718, AlSi10Mg, and Scalmalloy. This paper also highlights the potential that using synchrotron X-ray diffraction to study AM parts and constituent AM powder has to gain crucial insight into material properties and the build reliability of end use production quality parts from AM.
