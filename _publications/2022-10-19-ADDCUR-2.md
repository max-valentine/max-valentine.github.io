excerpt: 'As the flexibility and reliability of additive manufacturing (AM) and its corresponding design tools increases, AM is becoming a viable option for many industries. One particular application area that could benefit from AM is composite component manufacture. The layup and moulding of composite materials face significant challenges presented by increasingly compressed design timescales, growing demand for productivity, and the soaring complexity of components and end products. Furthermore, the UK has made sustainability a priority to meet its obligation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 68% by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050. While lightweight composite structures are expected to help reduce emissions during operation, energy is still the single biggest factor in the lifecycle analysis of the manufacturing process. The way in which composite curing equipment and tooling are designed and manufactured has not changed since high-performance composites were first used in aerospace applications in the 1970s. Therefore, there is an immediate potential to save energy by reducing the mass of the curing equipment and tooling and enhancing process heat transmission. As a result of the aspect ratio of typical composite parts and therefore the size of the required autoclaves, energy is wasted heating and cooling the thermal mass of the curing equipment and tooling during each curing cycle. The poor heat transfer attainable by convection in autoclaves exacerbates this inefficiency.'

As the flexibility and reliability of additive manufacturing (AM) and its corresponding design tools increases, AM is becoming a viable option for many industries. One particular application area that could benefit from AM is composite component manufacture. The layup and moulding of composite materials face significant challenges presented by increasingly compressed design timescales, growing demand for productivity, and the soaring complexity of components and end products. Furthermore, the UK has made sustainability a priority to meet its obligation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 68% by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050. While lightweight composite structures are expected to help reduce emissions during operation, energy is still the single biggest factor in the lifecycle analysis of the manufacturing process. The way in which composite curing equipment and tooling are designed and manufactured has not changed since high-performance composites were first used in aerospace applications in the 1970s. Therefore, there is an immediate potential to save energy by reducing the mass of the curing equipment and tooling and enhancing process heat transmission. As a result of the aspect ratio of typical composite parts and therefore the size of the required autoclaves, energy is wasted heating and cooling the thermal mass of the curing equipment and tooling during each curing cycle. The poor heat transfer attainable by convection in autoclaves exacerbates this inefficiency.
